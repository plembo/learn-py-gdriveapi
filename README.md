Google Workspace (formerly GSuite) accounts are different from personal, non-Workspace, accounts. This is primarily because Workspace accounts belong to an organization (domain), while personal accounts do not. As a result, applications using Workspace accounts can be configured for authentication purposes as "Internal" (as part of an organization) or "External". Google personal accounts can only be configured as "External". The examples given in the tutorial assume that the developer is working with a Workspace account.
